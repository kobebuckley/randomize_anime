# randomize_anime

( Referencing Tina Huang Youtube Channel Project Idea)

 Project #1 - Self Learning

    • Python
        ◦ Lists
        ◦ random module
        ◦ input function
      
    • Advanced
        ◦ Pandas
        ◦ Apis


        Base Project:
        
        1. Put all recommended anime in a list in Python 
        2. Randomly choose one and print


        Upgraded Project:
        
        1. Make a sublist with anime parameters
        2. Use the input function (mood, runtime, series/movie)

        
        Advanced Project: 
        
        1. Jikan
        2. Pandas
        3. from command line input to a website / UI interface

        
        High Level Project: (still thinking about overall ideas for this one ... )

        Adding in Django + Node Js 
        creating an app where people can join a room using a code, then choose anime based off of checkboxes, then can vote on which random anime selected is what they all want by casting votes. (Jikan APi)

        (maybe a feature/checkbox for different levels, such as N5 japanese for learning etc.,)
        group learn from an anime  ( Jisho and DeepL Apis')

        other random api 

        (trace.moe API)

        ----------------------
        Non APi 
        https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/ccghhs/is_there_a_site_for_anime_transcripts_or_anime/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=comments_view_all


        to grab anime that has a script (will search websites that have scripts) and also have checboxes for episode, etc, 



        -> found the anime eng + jp subs (Kitsunekko)
        Jp -> https://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2Fjapanese%2F
        Eng -> https://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2F

        Can also add a link to grammar explanations (can be found easily throihg copy & pasting the grammar) -> through Control f or maybe a feature that does it for you?  (Itazuraneko.neocities.org)



* figure out the rate limiter for APi's
* later add a sign on feature to make accounts, track studying time, track who was in your group with u and how long, etc.,
